# devops bash scripting

This is the repository where I am going to learn about bash-scripting

## Alos names are given like 01,02,03......

## few of the git commands which are used 

1)git clone reponame      : download the whole repository
2)git pull                : download only the changes
3)git add filename        : Git will star tracking the changes that are making on the file named filenames
4)git commit -m "msg Name": adding msg to commit / the changes made in the code
5)git push                : changes will be pushed to repo

## PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to executre the git commands ; We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
